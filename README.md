Here goes some screwball !
* [binary_integer.ipynb](binary_integer.ipynb) : train a network to 'predict' decimal value of binary numbers from 0000-1001 
* [load_companies](load_companies/juggard.py) : Pull a table from my placement portal (iitm) and show new companies registered after my recent login in terminal.
